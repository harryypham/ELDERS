# ELDERS

COVID-19 pandemic has left so many losses to the world. Above all of the consequences of Covid 19, the biggest issue that the pandemic brings to the world is mental health illness. In the United States, about 4 in 10 people have reported anxiety disorders or depression during the pandemic. In contrast, only about 1 in 10 people in the U.S had the same symptoms before the pandemic. The statistic shows a significant number of people has mental health illness.

The old generation has always been vulnerable to disease as their immune systems are weaker. Facing the high probability of passing away and the sudden death can be one reason that affects a person’s mental health. In January 2021, nearly 36 percent of adults in the United States reported that death anxiety had become their major fear in the severity of the pandemic. This statistic demonstrates the significance of this issue. In realizing this issue, our team gathers to propose a solution to eliminating death anxiety: ELDERS

## Description:

Our product is designed to target Gen X. We have built a website that would be most appropriate to people in the selected group range with this specific goal.

First of all, our team chose the name of our project as ELDERS to come straight to our targeted audience. As the audience wants to sign up, they will be asked to fill in basic information such as name and date of birth. After that, there will be four different tabs for the users to interact with.

The first and second tabs, named “Family” and “Friends,” will allow users to create name tags for their family members. Each name tag includes personal information and a picture attached to remind users of the meaningful moment with each member added. This process tells users that they are not alone. This feature also assists users with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease to learn about their family and friends with the support of a member who takes care of users.

The third and fourth tabs, named “Bucket List” and “Inspiration,” will help users plan such an exciting event for themselves by listing out what they want to eat, play, and enjoy with their beloved persons. The “Inspiration” tab will be your next supporter if users are out of ideas. This tab is linked to YouTube and some interesting articles which give you some ideal recommendations for your activities bucket list.

Coming to “Diary,” users can spend time for a daily reflection to keep track of their mood and emotions. Feel free to express your thoughts and feelings every day, every time, and moment. We are pleased to be with you in your life! We believe that sharing and writing diaries are incredible actions that help users feel relieved. This technical diary also reduces losing a notebook or a piece of paper for the seniors.

Lastly, the “Testament” is the main feature of this website to fight death anxiety. If you are afraid of not sharing words with your family and friends, we serve you a free space where you can write down their wills, final thoughts, reminders for their beloved people. This tab requires a log-in password to improve privacy.

## The challenge we ran into

Building a healthcare website to help people, especially seniors, stay away from death anxiety.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of

Our team is proud of our unique invention to help people fight against death anxiety. We target the seniors, but we also believe that this website can help people in every age vision lives more positively. We hope that the death anxiety and suicide rate will decrease in this death-denial world.

## What did we learn?

We learned a lot from each member of our team. We have a great time working and building this app together. We also gain significant knowledge in targeting death anxiety and mental illness among the elderly during the pandemic.

## What is next for ELDERS?

We will try to improve the “Testament” feature for the website. It will be linked to users' email in the future, so we can send to the email a PDF file of the testament once the user passes away. Moreover, we will continue learning about security tools to develop and maintain this web as securely as possible to increase the website's credibility.
